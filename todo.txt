1. Decide how to use all methods in context of root object (without required object and key in parameters).
	I.e. we need set object, key and dom object once in init function and then all method must know content.
	Needs code review.

2. Implement rendering. Needs additional work on models initialization.
Notes about plates parameter: needs to use it if childCommandsBySid is empty

3. Thought about testing.

4. Rendering on server-side? Make estimation for this feature.
